# Python Generator

Here’s a clean, well-structured **README.md** based on all your tasks and solutions.
I included a concise description for each task, usage, and credits (including credit to me as requested ✨).

## Python Generators

### 🚀 About the Project

This project introduces advanced usage of **Python generators** to efficiently handle large datasets, process data in batches, and simulate real-world scenarios such as live updates and memory-efficient computations.

The tasks focus on leveraging Python’s `yield` keyword to implement generators that provide **iterative access** to data, promoting optimal resource utilization and improving performance in data-driven applications.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, I achieved the following:

* **Master Python Generators:** Created and utilized generators for iterative data processing, enabling memory-efficient operations.
* **Handle Large Datasets:** Implemented batch processing and lazy loading to work with extensive datasets without overloading memory.
* **Simulate Real-world Scenarios:** Developed solutions to simulate live data updates and streaming contexts.
* **Optimize Performance:** Used generators to calculate aggregate functions like averages on large datasets without loading everything into memory.
* **Apply SQL Knowledge:** Integrated SQL queries with Python generators for robust data management.

### ⚙️ Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Familiarity with `yield` and generator functions
* Basic understanding of SQL (MySQL)
* Knowledge of database schema design and seeding
* Git and GitHub for version control

---

### 💡 Tasks Overview

#### ✅ **0. Getting started with Python generators**

* **Objective:** Seed the MySQL database (`ALX_prodev`) and create a `user_data` table.
* **Features:**

  * Set up database connection and table schema.
  * Populate table from `user_data.csv`.
* **Key Functions:**

  * `connect_db()`
  * `create_database()`
  * `connect_to_prodev()`
  * `create_table()`
  * `insert_data()`

---

#### ✅ **1. Generator that streams rows from an SQL database**

* **Objective:** Create a generator that streams rows one by one from the `user_data` table.
* **Key Function:**

  * `stream_users()`
* **Usage:** Iterates over each user record without loading all rows at once.

---

#### ✅ **2. Batch Processing Large Data**

* **Objective:** Create a generator to fetch and process data in **batches**.
* **Key Functions:**

  * `stream_users_in_batches(batch_size)`
  * `batch_processing(batch_size)` — filters users above age 25 and processes them in batches.
* **Constraint:** Maximum of three loops.

---

#### ✅ **3. Lazy Loading Paginated Data**

* **Objective:** Simulate fetching paginated data from the `user_data` table using lazy loading.
* **Key Functions:**

  * `paginate_users(page_size, offset)`
  * `lazy_pagination(page_size)` — loads each page only when needed.
* **Constraint:** One loop only.

---

#### ✅ **4. Memory-Efficient Aggregation with Generators**

* **Objective:** Use a generator to compute the **average age** without loading all data at once.
* **Key Functions:**

  * `stream_users_ages()` — yields ages one by one.
  * `average_age()` — computes the average using a single loop.
* **Constraint:** Cannot use SQL `AVG()`.
